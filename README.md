"Laziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired." Jules Renard

elvn - time management for nerds.

We are living in the world where everything is routinely organized and ready for accounting report. We are surrounded with calendars, planners, bug-trackers, to-do lists, metrics, and every tool or methodology tries to impose its concepts of what is important. elvn is attempting to find out new answers for the common time planning questions and to transform a working day from mechanical execution of "very important" tasks into an amazing journey where inspirational ideas become true. In addition, elvn is a convenient tool that helps to manage your own time avoiding any excess.

The 3 time planning questions are :
  
  1. What should I do?
  2. What am I going to do today?
  3. How should I focus on a task?

elvn answers
  
  1. Everything is an idea, note your idea and if it's worth of doing and could be estimated move it to the task list.
  2. Plan to have 4-6 intentions to embody ideas, each idea should not take more than an hour.
  3. Select a task, have a rest first, be elvn for an hour and move to the next task.
